# Credit Risk Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
This challenge asks to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, the task was to oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms and then to undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Next, I used a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Finally, I compared two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. This report outlines the finding of these models and compares them to make a judgement on which supervised machine learning model is most accurate.

## Results
The following lists the machine learning model used and then shows the output for their respective balanced accuracy, precision, and recall scores.
